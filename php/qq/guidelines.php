<h2>Guidelines for new MusicThoughts</h2>

<div id="guidelines-intro">
<p>
This is just a small collection of beautiful, profound, inspiring quotes about music.
</p><p>
Since I pay professional translators by the word, each new quote added to the site costs me about $20.
</p><p>
New quotes are added to the site if they meet these guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It's quoting someone else, not yourself. (It's profound enough to be quoted by others.)</li>
<li>It can be directly applied to making music.</li>
<li>It's inspiring, not just funny or complaining.</li>
<li>It's succinct. Every word is neccessary.</li>
<li>My reaction is, “Hmm... Really makes you think!”</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please don't be offended if a submitted quote is not added to this small collection.
</p><p>
Thank you!
