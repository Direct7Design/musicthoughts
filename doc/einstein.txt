We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are. -Anais Nin


hey derek!!  :)

just re-found this quote, one of my favorites... reminded me of you  
and keith richards and taking out every other line of the song.

"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is  
the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is  
a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe,  
is as good as dead: his eyes are closed." ~Albert Einstein

lovely, aint it?

and how did your gooey girl week go?  well, i hope.

let's catch up more soon. if nostradamus is right we will have to  
divide our 94 remaining conversations at an average of at least once  
every 15 days or so and we'll be safe.  :)

happy nine.
